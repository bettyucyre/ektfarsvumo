## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check any emails or messages from Battlestate Games to pinpoint the reason. Common bans happen for:
- Cheating, hacks, or third-party tools  
- Toxic or abusive behavior in-game or on forums  
- Account sharing, trading, or suspicious activity  

**Pro tip:** Always skim through the Tarkov user agreement so you don’t accidentally break the rules again before appealing.
